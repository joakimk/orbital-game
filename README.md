Not really a game, more of a unrealistic orbit-simulator made in Elm.

The initial version was made on my flight home from #socratesUK 2016.

## Live demo

- [Mostly balanced system](https://rawgit.com/joakimk/orbital-game/master/examples/index.html)
- [Unbalanced system](https://rawgit.com/joakimk/orbital-game/master/examples/index-unbalanced.html)

## How to run

Get Elm 0.17, then:

    elm package install -y
    elm-reactor

And visit <http://localhost:8000/Main.elm>.

## How to release

This will create a "index.html" containing all the needed javascript. You also need the images in `textures/`.

    elm make Main.elm

## TODO

If I get around to it I'd like to...

* [x] Get orbits to work when more planets have gravity
* [x] Orient the planets toward the sun at all times so that the textures match
* [ ] Stable orbital physics. Probably slower orbits, but be able to speed up time to debug.
* [x] Twinkling stars.
* [ ] Merge this into my other game (adds player code, moving perspective, hot code swapping, etc)
  * [ ] Step1: Copy the star field, make it scroll.
